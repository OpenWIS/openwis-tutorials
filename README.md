# OpenWIS - Pilots tutorials

This repository hosts a series of mini-tutorials to bring the audience up to speed to the core concepts and technologies envisaged to be used in future versions of OpenWIS. Each tutorial is composed of theoretical information as well as - where applicable - source code to demonstrate the concepts. As most tutorials build on the knowledge presented in a previous tutorial, we suggest they are read in ascending order.
